Our risk plan will include the analysis we did earlier in the process on the various impacts that could affect our change.

Here we want to include:

* The range of risks we identified and whether they are internal or external
* Our risk assessment
* Our response plan
* Our risk monitoring activities

For more information on risks, we can consult ''[https://articles.alpha.canada.ca/framework-for-leading-change/?page_id=315 Section 4: Capacity, readiness and impact / Understanding our risks]''.

There are a variety of templates we can use if we choose to do so. One example is based on a [https://articles.alpha.canada.ca/uploads/sites/46/2022/11/Risk-plan-template.doc risk management plan] developed at the Department of National Defence.
