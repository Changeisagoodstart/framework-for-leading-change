Our risk plan will include the analysis we did earlier in the process on the various impacts that could affect our change.

Here we want to include:

- The range of risks we identified and whether they are internal or external

- Our risk assessment

- Our response plan

- Our risk monitoring activities

For more information on risks, we can consult _[Section 4: Capacity, readiness and impact / Understanding our risks](https://articles.alpha.canada.ca/framework-for-leading-change/?page_id=315)_.

There are a variety of templates we can use if we choose to do so. One example is based on a [risk management plan](https://articles.alpha.canada.ca/uploads/sites/46/2022/11/Risk-plan-template.doc) developed at the Department of National Defence.
