Our change team is a crucial factor in the success of the change. We want to define not only who is part of our change team but also the way the team works. While there is no set way of developing the ideal change team, there are a number of characteristics that contribute to the success of an individual/team in the world of change.

For the individual, among others, these include:

* Attend to the needs of the organization as a whole
* Empathetic, caring and considerate of others’ needs
* Personally empowered and responsible
* Collaborative and supportive
* Learning and development-oriented
* Able to build relationships and achieve results

Having these types of “soft skills” is essential for anyone working in an environment that is changing. The closer we get to understanding how the change is affecting people at a fundamental level, the more likely we will be able to formulate an effective change strategy and avoided unintended negative consequences.

For teams, among others, these include (from Glaser and Glaser 1992):

* Clear team mission, planning and goal setting
* Well-defined team roles and responsibilities
* Agreed upon team operating processes and procedures
* Strong interpersonal relationships among the team
* Strong relationships with other teams

These characteristics are important to the proper functioning of a flexible team, supporting change. They allow for clarity of values/goals, dialogue and the development of trust, both within the team and among the team and stakeholders.
