Our _project shepherd (or sponsor)_ is the highest authority accountable for the change. The project shepherd demonstrates the change leadership behaviours and mindset that lead to project success (see _[Section 1: How to get into a change leadership mindset](/change-management-and-change-leadership/)_, and the change leader worksheet below). The shepherd has authority to unlock (or seek) funding, resolve issues, approve major deliverables and provide high-level direction. Common responsibilities, which can be accomplished with the help of the supporting change leadership team and key stakeholders, include:

- Identifying goals and measurable outcomes for the change

- Assessing gaps between current and future ways

- Ensuring stakeholders understand the value and importance of addressing the gaps

- Providing necessary support and resources for successful change progression and completion

**Being a change shepherd**

There are a number of practices that the change shepherd can follow to better prepare and lead the change. These are informed by a change leadership mindset (there is more on this in [_How to get into a change leadership mindset_ in section 1](/change-management-and-change-leadership/). Below is a worksheet that can help us identify whether we are fulfilling our role as the change shepherd. These are to be revisited throughout the process.

_Our champion(s)_is(are) the face of the initiative and will bring the change vision to life. They are influential in a particular sector, in their department and/or across the government and usually occupy an executive role. Common responsibilities include:

- Supporting the project shepherd in decision-making

- Mobilizing key stakeholders in supporting and implementing the change

- Demonstrating desired behaviours at the onset of the initiative (early adopter)

- Involving and engaging all stakeholders and sustaining employee morale

- Inviting stakeholders to participate in an active or coordinative role, as appropriate

_The organization’s senior change leadership team_ is the group of senior executives with decision-making authority who are directly mandated to lead the change initiative. In large organizations this group could be made up of a sample of representatives

_The senior leadership cadre_ consists of senior leadership (executives and managers) who will apply the new changes in their branch/sector/unit. They are not necessarily part of the senior change leadership team. However, they will need to exercise positive leadership over the change.

_The dedicated change team_ is mandated with supporting the shepherd, the senior change leadership team_._ They are change experts and coaches involved in supporting the initiative. Such a team is generally led by a change director/manager who is in charge of specific aspects of the change. Common responsibilities include:

- Coordinating and integrating activities to realize the objectives of the change

- Ensuring the day-to-day management of the change

- Planning and directing change activities

The disciplines of change management/change leadership, project management, and business process management all offer structures of roles and responsibilities at both the individual and group levels. We can keep in mind that we may need to harmonize our change roles with those based on these other disciplines to simplify the structure we are building for the purpose of leading and managing our change initiative.
