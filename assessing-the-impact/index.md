Understanding the impact the change could have on stakeholders, especially the workforce, and the organization is a crucial part of the process. At this point we have had ongoing discussions with staff and other key stakeholders. We likely understand fairly well what our change entails, including our drivers and barriers, vision and conditions for success.

We also know the environment relatively well, including interdependencies and change saturation. With this knowledge in hand we can get to the heart of the matter and look at how our organization and stakeholders will be affected by the change.

Here we will conduct:

- [An organizational impact assessment](organizational-impact-assessment/)

- [A stakeholder impact assessment](stakeholder-impact-assessment/)
