Communications is another vital component of any change initiative. While the timing, tone and content will be different for each change (and at different points in the process), there are a number of principles we can follow to ensure we are communicating change effectively.

These include:

- Fostering a dialogue

- Communicating by giving meaning

- Building trust through authenticity and modelling our actions

- Choosing messengers wisely

- Being intentional about the type of conversation thatâ€™s happening

There are also some general communications principles we can follow, including:

- Crafting our message for maximum impact

- Choosing the best time to communicate

- Knowing and understanding our audiences

- Selecting the best combination of channels

- Collaborating to amplify our communications

**\*_Note_**_: For more information on these principles we can consult the_ [_Change Communications Principles_](https://articles.alpha.canada.ca/uploads/sites/46/2023/03/Change_communications_principles.pdf) _developed by the Center for Strategic Change at Public Services and Procurement Canada._

There are a variety of templates we can use if we choose to do so. One example is based on a [communications plan](https://articles.alpha.canada.ca/uploads/sites/46/2022/11/Communications-plan-template.doc) developed at the Department of National Defence.

A second example is the [communications plan template](https://wiki.gccollab.ca/images/c/c7/002_WCM_Communication_Plan_Template.docx) developed by the Change Management National Centre of Expertise in Accommodation Management and Workplace Solutions at Public Services and Procurement Canada.

**_\*Note_**_: the communications plan template is specific to workplace modernization in the public service but can be adapted to suit other changes. Further, this template is based on the ADKAR model from the Prosci methodology and provides space to include content related to this. Because our approach may not be based on Prosci, we can just remove these sections in the template._
