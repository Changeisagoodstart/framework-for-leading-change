In this section we lay the foundation for the particular change that is being introduced. Here we can start gathering and fleshing out some key components of our change strategy. This is crucial in setting the stage for a successful outcome and is greatly enhanced through introspection, discussion and engagement.

Here we will:

- [Develop a draft stakeholder list](/framework-for-leading-change/stakeholders-and-change/)

- [Building our change team](/framework-for-leading-change/building-our-change-team/)

- [Learn how to apply the formula for successful change](/framework-for-leading-change/the-formula-for-successful-change/)

- [Determine what is driving our change](/framework-for-leading-change/our-drivers-and-barriers-of-change/)

- [Develop our case for the change](/framework-for-leading-change/building-our-case-for-change/)

- [Develop our vision](/framework-for-leading-change/creating-our-vision-of-the-future/)

- [Set out our conditions for success](/framework-for-leading-change/setting-out-our-conditions-for-success/)

- [Think about the signals and strategic levers we may need to employ](/framework-for-leading-change/sending-strong-signals/)
