In this section we delve more into the specifics of where our change fits within the broader context. This will help us better understand some of the factors that may affect our change and to situate ourselves among the various initiatives already happening (in our department and elsewhere).

Here we will:

- [Analyze the environment in which the change is taking place](https://articles.alpha.canada.ca/framework-for-leading-change/analyzing-the-environment/)

- [Determine where our change fits in the broader organization](https://articles.alpha.canada.ca/framework-for-leading-change/determining-where-our-change-fits/)

- [Look at interdependencies with other change initiatives and programs currently underway](https://articles.alpha.canada.ca/framework-for-leading-change/understanding-our-interdependencies/)
