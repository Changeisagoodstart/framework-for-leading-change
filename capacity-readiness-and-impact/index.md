In this section we get a better sense of how solid the foundation for change is in our organization, the level of change saturation, and how ready we are for change.

Here we will:

- [Examine organizational change maturity](/framework-for-leading-change/organizational-change-maturity/)

- [Analyze our change saturation and fatigue](/framework-for-leading-change/change-saturation-and-fatigue/)

- [Assess how ready we are to implement the change](/framework-for-leading-change/assess-how-ready-we-are-to-implement-the-change/)

- [Assess leadership capacity for change](/framework-for-leading-change/assess-our-leaderships-capacity-for-change/)

- [Assess the impact of the change](/framework-for-leading-change/assessing-the-impact/)
